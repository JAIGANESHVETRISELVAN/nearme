These include Arulmigu Kapaleeswarar Temple, with its pyramid-shaped tower; the colonial-era Luz Church, with an ornate, frescoed interior; and the Gothic-style Santhome Cathedral, built on the burial site of Saint Thomas. Chennai Lighthouse on sandy Gandhi Beach features a viewing gallery that's open to the public.
